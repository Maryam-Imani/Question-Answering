I have a 9 year old Badger 1 that needs replacing, will this Badger 1 install just like the original one?
so can this unit be connected with a dishwasher or do I need a different model?
can I replace Badger 1 1/3 with a Badger 5 1/2 - with same connections?
Does this come with power cord and dishwasher hook up?
loud noise inside when turned on. sounds like blades are loose
where is the reset button located
I have a badger 5 it is leaking water at bottom near reset bottom plus does a new one came with a ss ring for inside the sink
